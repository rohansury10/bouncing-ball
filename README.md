# bouncing-ball
A bouncing ball project is a simple physics or programming exercise that demonstrates concepts like gravity, energy, motion, and collisions.  When a ball drops, gravity pulls it down.  On hitting the ground, it bounces back up, but not as high (because some energy is lost to sound, heat, or deformation).  The motion repeats until it stops.
